# FS-INFO - Public Assets Docs Folder

!!!Note
    This file provides an overview of the root-level `assets/docs` folder's role and **typical** content. If available, project-specific documentation is found in the folder's `README.md`.

## Overview

The root-level `assets/docs/` folder is dedicated to housing downloadable document files that are intended for end users or stakeholders. These documents are directly accessible via the application's URL structure and are typically provided for reference, compliance, or informational purposes.

By organizing document files in the root `docs/` folder, the project maintains a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and update the application's downloadable documentation assets. This structure also facilitates efficient delivery and caching of document files.

## Folder's Role

The root-level `assets/docs/` folder plays a crucial role in supporting the application's informational and compliance needs by providing downloadable documents such as PDFs, Word documents, or other formats. These assets may include user manuals, technical documentation, legal notices, licenses, or other resources that need to be distributed to users.

Additionally, this folder ensures that all document-related assets are centralized and well-organized. By maintaining a dedicated location for downloadable documents, developers and content managers can efficiently manage, update, and expand the application's documentation offerings without disrupting other parts of the project. This approach promotes scalability and maintainability, ensuring that the application's document assets remain consistent and accessible.
