!!!Note
    This file provides an overview of the root-level `assets/icons` folder's role and **typical** content. If available, a project-specific documentation is to be found in the folder's `README`.

## Overview

The root-level `assets/icons/` folder is designated for storing icon files used throughout the application to enhance the user interface and provide visual cues.

By organizing icons in this dedicated folder, the project maintains a clear separation of assets, making it easier to manage and update the application's visual elements. This structure also facilitates efficient delivery of icons to the client.

## Folder's Role

The root-level `assets/icons/` folder plays a crucial role in managing the application's visual identity. It serves as a centralized repository for all icon assets, ensuring consistency and uniformity across the user interface. By storing icons in a dedicated folder, the project simplifies the process of locating, updating, and maintaining these assets, which is essential for a scalable and maintainable application.

Additionally, this folder supports the application's design system by providing a single source of truth for iconography. This approach minimizes redundancy, reduces the risk of inconsistencies, and ensures that all icons adhere to the project's branding guidelines. The folder's organization also improves collaboration among team members by providing a clear and predictable structure for managing visual assets.

## Folder's Typical Content

This folder contains icon files that are directly accessible via the application's URL structure and are typically used in buttons, menus, and other UI components.

### Folder's Typical Tree Structure
