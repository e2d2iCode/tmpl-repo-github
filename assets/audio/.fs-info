## Overview

The root-level `assets/audio/` folder is dedicated to housing audio files that are essential for the application's auditory features. These files are directly accessible via the application's URL structure and are typically loaded by the browser or media players to deliver audio content to users.

By organizing audio files in the root `audio/` folder, the project maintains a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and update the application's audio assets. This structure also facilitates efficient delivery and caching of audio files.

## Folder's Role

Additionally, this folder ensures that all audio-related assets are centralized and well-organized. By maintaining a dedicated location for audio files, developers can efficiently manage, update, and expand the application's auditory features without disrupting other parts of the project. This approach promotes scalability and maintainability, ensuring that the application's audio assets remain consistent and accessible.
