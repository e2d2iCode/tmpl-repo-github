!!!Note
    This file provides an overview of the folder's role and **typical** content. If available, a project-specific documentation is to be found in the folder's `README`.

## Overview

The `assets/videos/` folder is located at the root of the application's public assets directory. It is dedicated to housing video files that are essential for the application's multimedia functionality. These videos are directly accessible via the application's URL structure and can be embedded or streamed within the application.

By organizing video files in the root-level `videos/` folder, the project maintains a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and update multimedia content. This structure also facilitates efficient delivery of video assets to the client.

## Folder's Role

The `assets/videos/` folder plays a crucial role in enhancing the application's multimedia experience by providing a centralized location for storing video files. These videos are used across various features or presentations, ensuring a consistent and engaging user experience. By maintaining all video assets in one location, the folder simplifies the process of managing and updating multimedia content, reducing the risk of errors or inconsistencies.

Additionally, this folder supports the application's scalability by enabling efficient delivery of video files to the client. The folder's structure ensures that video assets are easily accessible and can be seamlessly integrated into the application's features. This approach not only improves the application's performance but also enhances its maintainability and adaptability to future requirements.
