# FS-INFO - Project Root Folder

!!!Note
    This file provides an overview of the folder's role and **typical** content. If available, a project-specific documentation is to be found in the folder's `README`.

## Overview

The root folder is the top-level directory of the project. It is structured to provide a clear and organized layout, making it easy for developers to navigate and understand the project's structure. This folder includes configuration files, documentation, and subdirectories that house the source code, tests, and other resources.

By following established conventions, the root folder ensures that the project remains maintainable and accessible to both new and experienced developers. Each file and subfolder within the root directory serves a specific purpose, contributing to the overall functionality and organization of the project.

## Folder's Role

The root folder plays a crucial role in organizing and centralizing all the essential components of the project. It serves as the foundation for the application's development, configuration, and deployment. By consolidating these resources in one location, the folder enhances collaboration, reduces onboarding time for new contributors, and ensures consistency in development practices.

Additionally, this folder fosters a culture of transparency and efficiency within the project. By maintaining a well-structured and organized layout, it empowers contributors to make informed decisions, troubleshoot issues effectively, and align their efforts with the project's objectives. This centralized approach minimizes miscommunication and ensures that all contributors, regardless of their experience level, have access to the same foundational resources.

## Folder's Typical Content

The root folder contains a mix of files and subfolders, each serving a distinct role in the project's lifecycle. Below is the current structure of the root folder:

The following sections provide a comprehensive overview of the files and subfolders within the root directory.

### Files Description

This section provides a detailed explanation of each file within the root folder. It outlines their purpose, key responsibilities, and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the project.

#### .env

Environment variable definitions for local development.
This file typically contains sensitive or machine-specific configuration values (such as API keys, database URLs, or secret tokens) that are loaded at runtime. It is usually excluded from version control to protect sensitive data.

**Example content:**

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
SECRET_TOKEN=your-secret-token
```

**Best practices:**

- Never commit this file to version control.
- Use `.env.example` or `.env.required` to document required variables.

#### .env.required

Lists required environment variables for the project.
This file documents all environment variables that must be set for the application to run correctly, serving as a checklist for developers and deployment environments.

**Example content:**

```plaintext
# Required environment variables
DATABASE_URL=
API_KEY=
SECRET_TOKEN=
```

**Usage:**

- Developers should copy this file to `.env` and fill in the values.
- CI/CD pipelines can validate that all required variables are set.

#### .gitattributes

This file is used to define path-specific settings and behaviors in Git.
It ensures consistent handling of files across different environments and contributors, such as line endings, diff settings, and merge strategies for specific file types.

**Example content:**

```plaintext
*.js text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
*.md diff=markdown
```

**Usage:**

- Prevents issues with line endings across OSes.
- Improves merge and diff behavior for certain file types.

#### .gitconfig

A user-specific configuration file for Git that defines settings such as the user's name and email, aliases for common commands, and preferences like default branch names.
It can also include project-specific Git behaviors and overrides.

**Example content:**

```plaintext
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = your.email@example.com
[core]
    editor = code --wait
[alias]
    co = checkout
    br = branch
```

**Usage:**

- Can be used to enforce project-specific Git settings.
- Typically, user-level `.gitconfig` is in the home directory, but a project-level file can override settings.

#### .gitignore

Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore, such as build artifacts, dependency folders, and temporary files.
Helps keep the repository clean by preventing accidental commits of files that do not belong in version control.

**Example content:**

```plaintext
node_modules/
dist/
.env
*.log
```

**Usage:**

- Add patterns for files/folders that should not be tracked by Git.

#### .watchmanconfig

A configuration file for Watchman, used to optimize development workflows by monitoring file changes and triggering actions.
It can be used to ignore certain files or directories and to fine-tune file watching behavior for performance.

**Example content:**

```plaintext
{
  "ignore_dirs": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

**Usage:**

- Improves performance of file watchers in large projects.

#### CHANGELOG.md

A markdown file documenting the project's history of changes, listing versions, added features, fixed bugs, and breaking changes.
It provides a chronological record for users and contributors to track the evolution of the project.

**Example structure:**

```plaintext
## [1.0.1] - 2024-06-01
### Fixed
- Fixed bug in authentication module.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-05-20
### Added
- Initial release.
```

**Usage:**

- Update this file with each release to communicate changes to users and contributors.

#### CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

A document outlining expected behavior for contributors, fostering a positive and collaborative community. It sets standards for communication and helps maintain a welcoming environment.

This file typically includes:

- Guidelines for respectful and inclusive communication.
- Procedures for reporting unacceptable behavior.
- Consequences for violations.
- Contact information for reporting issues.

#### CONTRIBUTING.md

This file usually covers:

- Steps for setting up the project locally.
- Branching and commit message conventions.
- How to submit bug reports and feature requests.
- The process for submitting pull requests and code reviews.

#### LICENSE.md

A markdown file specifying the licensing terms for the project. It defines how the project's code can be used, modified, and distributed by others.

Typical contents include:

- The full text of the chosen open-source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL).
- Copyright and attribution requirements.
- Any project-specific licensing exceptions or clarifications.

#### README.md

The primary documentation file for the project, including an overview, installation instructions, and usage examples. It is often the first point of reference for new users and contributors.

A comprehensive README usually contains:

- Project description and purpose.
- Installation and setup instructions.
- Usage examples and common commands.

This file often includes:

- Steps for reporting security vulnerabilities.
- Expected response times.
- Security update and patching policies.
- Contact information for the security team.

### Subfolders Description

This section provides a quick explanation of each folder within the root directory. Detailed information is provided in their dedicated `.fs-info` files, if available.

#### .github/

Contains configuration files and templates for GitHub project management, such as workflow definitions (`workflows/`), issue and pull request templates, funding configuration, and other GitHub-specific automation or settings.

**Typical contents:**

- `workflows/`: YAML files defining CI/CD pipelines (e.g., build, test, deploy).
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: Templates for bug reports and feature requests.
- `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: Standardizes pull request submissions.
