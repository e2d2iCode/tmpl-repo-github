# FS-INFO - Project Root Folder

!!!Note
    This file provides an overview of the folder's role and **typical** content. If available, a project-specific documentation is to be found in the folder's `README`.

## Overview

The root folder is the top-level directory of the project. It is structured to provide a clear and organized layout, making it easy for developers to navigate and understand the project's structure. This folder includes configuration files, documentation, and subdirectories that house the source code, tests, and other resources.

By following established conventions, the root folder ensures that the project remains maintainable and accessible to both new and experienced developers. Each file and subfolder within the root directory serves a specific purpose, contributing to the overall functionality and organization of the project.

## Folder's Role

The root folder plays a crucial role in organizing and centralizing all the essential components of the project. It serves as the foundation for the application's development, configuration, and deployment. By consolidating these resources in one location, the folder enhances collaboration, reduces onboarding time for new contributors, and ensures consistency in development practices.

Additionally, this folder fosters a culture of transparency and efficiency within the project. By maintaining a well-structured and organized layout, it empowers contributors to make informed decisions, troubleshoot issues effectively, and align their efforts with the project's objectives. This centralized approach minimizes miscommunication and ensures that all contributors, regardless of their experience level, have access to the same foundational resources.

## Folder's Typical Content

The root folder contains a mix of files and subfolders, each serving a distinct role in the project's lifecycle. Below is the current structure of the root folder:
