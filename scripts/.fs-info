!!!Note
    This file provides an overview of the folder's role and **typical** content. If available, project-specific details are to be found in the folder's `README`.

## Overview

The `scripts/` folder is dedicated to automation and utility scripts related to the project. It serves as a centralized location for scripts that help automate tasks such as building, testing, deployment, setup, and maintenance. By organizing scripts in this folder, the project ensures that contributors can easily find and use automation tools, improving workflow efficiency and consistency.

Scripts in this folder are typically written in languages such as Bash, PowerShell, Python, or JavaScript, depending on the project's requirements and target environments.

## Folder's Role

The `scripts/` folder plays a crucial role in:

- Automating build, test, and deployment processes
- Providing setup and configuration utilities
- Offering maintenance and housekeeping scripts
- Centralizing all automation resources that support the project's development and operations

This folder is intended to be the go-to resource for anyone seeking to automate or streamline project-related tasks.

## Typical Content

The scripts are usually organized by purpose or platform, and may include subfolders for grouping related scripts. Each script should be well-documented, either inline or via accompanying `README` files.
