## Overview

E2d2iApp provides a modern, scalable starting point for cross-platform application development. By leveraging React, React Native, React Native for Web, and Electron, it allows developers to maintain a single codebase for web, desktop, and mobile applications. The template is organized for clarity and extensibility, making it easy to adapt to a wide range of project requirements.

### Key goals

E2d2iApp is designed to help you quickly launch cross-platform projects with a focus on code reuse, scalability, and ease of setup.

- Accelerate the setup of new cross-platform projects.
- Promote code reuse and maintainability.
- Support rapid prototyping and scalable production apps.

### Target audience

Developers and teams seeking a unified workflow for building applications across multiple platforms with minimal configuration overhead.

This template is ideal for:

- Individual developers who want to quickly prototype ideas and deploy them to web, desktop, and mobile without maintaining separate codebases.
- Small to medium-sized teams aiming to maximize productivity by sharing logic, UI components, and business rules across platforms.
- Organizations looking to standardize their cross-platform development process and reduce onboarding time for new projects.
- Open-source contributors and maintainers who wish to provide a consistent developer experience for multi-platform apps.
- Educators and students interested in learning or teaching modern cross-platform development practices using popular frameworks.
- Startups and product teams that need to validate concepts on multiple platforms rapidly and cost-effectively.

Whether you are building internal tools, consumer-facing apps, or proof-of-concept projects, E2d2iApp provides a flexible foundation that adapts to a wide range of use cases and team sizes.

## Installation

To create a new project using this template, follow the step-by-step procedure below.

### 1. On GitHub

First create a new repository on GitHub using this template as the seed:

- Click the **"Use this template"** button on the [E2d2iApp GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-org/E2d2iApp).
- Choose a name for your new repository and complete the creation process.

### 2. Clone your new repository

Clone the newly created repository in your local development environment by running the following command in a terminal, or use a tool like GitHub Desktop.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-new-project.git
cd your-new-project
```

### 3. Install dependencies

   Install the project's dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:

#### Install dependencies with `npm`

```sh
npm install
yarn install
```

#### Install dependencies with `yarn`

```sh
  npm install
  yarn install
  ```

### 4. Set up platform-specific requirements
